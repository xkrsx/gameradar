The GameRadar is a full-stack web application where users can add and browse events based on sports.
It is a part of Sportradar Code Academy Coding Exercise (BE).

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Next.js
- Postgres.js
- Jest
- Playwright

## Database Setup

If you don't have PostgreSQL installed yet, follow the instructions from the PostgreSQL step in [UpLeveled's System Setup Instructions](https://github.com/upleveled/system-setup/blob/master/readme.md).

Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file called `.env` (ignored from Git) and fill in the necessary information.

Then, connect to the built-in `postgres` database as administrator in order to create the database:

**Windows**

If it asks for a password, use `postgres`.

```bash
psql -U postgres
```

**macOS**

```bash
psql postgres
```

**Linux**

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

Once you have connected, run the following to create the database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE <database name>;
CREATE USER <user name> WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '<user password>';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <database name> TO <user name>;
\connect <database name>
CREATE SCHEMA <schema name> AUTHORIZATION <user name>;
```

Quit `psql` using the following command:

```bash
\q
```

On Linux, it is [best practice to create an operating system user for each database](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/configuring_and_using_database_servers/using-postgresql_configuring-and-using-database-servers#con_postgresql-users_using-postgresql), to ensure that the operating system user can only access the single database and no other system resources. A different password is needed on Linux because [passwords of operating system users cannot contain the user name](https://github.com/upleveled/system-setup/issues/74). First, generate a random password and copy it:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 16
```

Then create the user, using the database user name from the previous section above. When you are prompted to create a password for the user, paste in the generated password.

```bash
sudo adduser <user name>
```

Once you're ready to use the new user, reconnect using the following command.

**Windows and macOS:**

```bash
psql -U <user name> <database name>
```

**Linux:**

```bash
sudo -u <user name> psql -U <user name> <database name>
```

## Run Tests

To run end-to-end tests with Playwright, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm playwright test
```
